### About

Life tends to get a bit hectic once an application gets deployed.
Is this version up-to-date? **Daniel**, did you remember to update
all the copies of your application?

There seem to be a lot of unnecessary issues that take far too long
to resolve simply because the application didn't get updated. All the
"hard work" of fixing the issue has already taken place, but forgetting
to push the update leaves the entire situation in a bind.

Instead of being reactive to app crashes and forgetfulness, I would
rather be proactive and use an AutoUpdating system. It might take a
few more minutes of work on the forefront, but it will save a lot of
time and headache in the end.
